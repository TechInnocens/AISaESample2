| System transparency | Making AI decisions understandable and explainable to users | Values being pursued - recommendation explanations and user control | Partial |
| Information integrity | Ensuring AI system provides accurate, reliable information | Values being pursued - content verification and quality assurance | In Progress |
| Data control | Ensuring users maintain control over their personal data | Opportunities being enhanced - privacy controls and user agency | Partial |

## User Stories (Optional - for teams wanting detailed implementation)
<!--%USER_STORIES-->
| Impact Area | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Status |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| Fairness and representation | As a user from any demographic group, I want to receive relevant and fair recommendations so that the system doesn't discriminate against my background | • No statistically significant bias across protected characteristics<br>• Equal recommendation quality metrics across user groups<br>• Regular fairness auditing and monitoring | In Progress |
| System transparency | As a user, I want to understand why content was recommended to me so that I can make informed decisions about what to consume | • Clear explanation for each recommendation<br>• User-friendly language avoiding technical jargon<br>• Option to provide feedback on recommendation relevance | In Progress |
| Information integrity | As a user, I want to receive accurate and trustworthy content recommendations so that I'm not exposed to misinformation | • Integration with fact-checking services<br>• Content quality scoring visible to users<br>• Reduced amplification of disputed information | In Progress |
| Data control | As a user, I want to control how my data is used for recommendations so that I maintain privacy and agency | • Granular privacy controls for different data types<br>• Easy data deletion and download capabilities<br>• Clear visibility of what data influences recommendations | Partial |
| System transparency | As a platform moderator, I want to understand how the recommendation algorithm works so that I can identify potential issues | • Algorithm documentation for internal teams<br>• Monitoring dashboard for recommendation patterns<br>• Audit trail for recommendation decisions | Not Started |
