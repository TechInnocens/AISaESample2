## Impact Areas Being Pursued (from Planning Record)
*Impact areas where values and opportunities are being implemented*
<!--%IMP_IMP-->
| Impact Area       | Description                               | Key Focus                                                      | Implementation Status         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Traffic Flow Efficiency | Reducing journey times and congestion | Values being pursued - optimising signal timing algorithms | Partial |
| Environmental Impact | Reducing emissions through optimised traffic flow | Opportunities being enhanced - modal shift incentives | Partial |
| Safety | Preventing accidents and protecting vulnerable road users | Values being pursued - pedestrian priority features | In Progress |
| Emergency Response | Prioritising emergency vehicle access | Values being pursued - emergency override protocols | Complete |
| Accessibility | Ensuring system works for all road users | Values being pursued - extended crossing times | Partial |

## User Stories (Optional - for teams wanting detailed implementation)
<!--%USER_STORIES-->
| Impact Area | User Story | Acceptance Criteria | Status |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| Traffic Flow Efficiency | As a traffic controller, I want real-time congestion optimisation so that overall journey times are minimised | • System reduces average journey time by 15%<br>• Peak hour congestion decreased by 20%<br>• Queue lengths monitored and managed | In Progress |
| Safety | As a pedestrian, I want safe crossing times so that I can cross without rushing | • Minimum 6-second buffer for pedestrian crossings<br>• Extended times for mobility-impaired users<br>• Audio signals for visually impaired | In Progress |
| Emergency Response | As an emergency services dispatcher, I want priority green corridors so that response times are minimised | • Emergency vehicles get green wave within 30 seconds<br>• System automatically clears routes<br>• Integration with emergency service systems | Complete |
| Environmental Impact | As a cyclist, I want optimised cycle routes so that cycling becomes more attractive than driving | • Cycle-friendly signal phases<br>• Integration with cycle counter data<br>• Reduced stop times for cycles | Not Started |
| Accessibility | As a disabled pedestrian, I want appropriate crossing times so that I can navigate safely | • Extended crossing times when requested<br>• Audio-visual accessibility features<br>• Integration with mobility aid detection | Partial |
