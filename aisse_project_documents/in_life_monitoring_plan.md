## Operational Risk Register
*Live risks that require ongoing management*
<!--%OP_RISKS-->
| Risk ID | Impact Area | Risk Description | Current Score | Status | Monitoring Method | Response Actions | Last Review |
|---------|-------------|------------------|---------------|--------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| *[To be transferred from risk management plan for live deployment]* | *[Impact Area]* | *[Operational risk description]* | *[Score]* | *[Status]* | *[How this risk is monitored]* | *[What to do if triggered]* | *[Date]* |

## Monitoring Activities
*What we monitor, how often, and who's responsible*
<!--%OP_MONITORS-->
| Metric/Indicator | Monitoring Method | Frequency | Responsible | Target/Baseline |
