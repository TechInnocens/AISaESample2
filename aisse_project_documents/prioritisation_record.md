# Planning & Prioritisation Record

## Project Context
*(These details are project-specific and will not be included in any reusable patterns)*

**Project Name** (full title of your project)
<!--%PROJ_NAME-->AI-Powered Content Recommendation System

**Current Development Stage** (choose from Concept, Prototype, Release Development, or Operations)
<!--%CURRENT_STAGE-->Prototype

## Stakeholder Input
[Brief summary of sessions/research conducted]

Conducted stakeholder engagement including workshops with content creators, user advocacy groups, platform safety teams, and regulatory compliance experts. Analysed user behaviour data and reviewed best practices from similar recommendation systems across different platforms and industries.

See guidance. Initially fill in first three columns of these two tables, then update later with MoSCoW decisions.
### Impact Areas & Values Identified
<!--%IMPACT_IN-->
| Impact Area       | Description     | Stakeholder Priority | MoSCoW      | Rationale |
| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Fairness and representation | Ensuring AI system works equitably for all user groups and doesn't discriminate | High | M | Core ethical requirement and regulatory compliance |
| System transparency | Making AI decisions understandable and explainable to users and stakeholders | High | M | User trust and regulatory transparency requirements |
| Information integrity | Ensuring AI system provides accurate, reliable information without misinformation | High | M | Platform responsibility and user safety priority |
| Data control | Ensuring users maintain control over their personal data and privacy | High | S | GDPR compliance and user rights, complex to implement fully |
| System security | Protecting AI system from external threats and malicious manipulation | Medium | S | Important for system integrity but lower immediate priority |
| Human agency and oversight | Maintaining human control and meaningful oversight of AI system decisions | Medium | C | Valuable for accountability but resource intensive |

### Risks Identified
<!--%RISKS_IN-->
| Impact Area | Risk | Description | Stakeholder Priority | MoSCoW | Rationale |
| ----------- | ---- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| Fairness and representation | Specific groups bear costs/risks disproportionately | Algorithm may systematically disadvantage certain user demographics | High | M | Legal and ethical requirement to address |
| System transparency | People do not understand and so don't trust how decisions are made | Users lose trust due to opaque recommendation algorithms | High | M | Critical for user adoption and regulatory compliance |
| Information integrity | System generates or spreads false misleading or harmful information | Recommendation system may amplify misinformation or harmful content | High | M | Platform safety and regulatory responsibility |
| Data control | People lose sight and control of their data | Users cannot understand or control how their data is used for recommendations | Medium | S | Privacy rights concern but complex implementation |
| System security | External manipulation of deployed system causing harmful decisions | Malicious actors could manipulate recommendations to cause harm | Medium | S | Security threat requiring ongoing vigilance |
| System security | Compromise of development pipeline leading to harmful system behaviours | Security breach during development could introduce malicious code | Medium | S | Development security concern |
| Human agency and oversight | System optimises to counteract restrictions as goal/reward | AI system may find ways to bypass safety restrictions we implement | Low | C | Emergent risk requiring research, not immediate priority |

### Tensions between values
See guidance. Record here any tensions noted in the process of identifying Values and Risks

- Transparency vs. Security: Explaining how recommendations work may reveal exploitable system vulnerabilities
- Personalisation vs. Privacy: Better recommendations require more user data, conflicting with data minimisation
- Fairness vs. Performance: Ensuring equal outcomes for all groups may reduce overall system effectiveness
- User Agency vs. Engagement: Giving users full control may reduce platform engagement and revenue
- Safety vs. Freedom: Content filtering may restrict legitimate expression and diverse viewpoints

## AISSE Decisions

**AISSE Badge level commitment** (Bronze/Silver/Gold):<!--%BADGE_LEVEL-->Silver

**Rationale:** 
Consumer-facing platform with significant user impact but manageable scope. Silver level commitment ensures thorough risk assessment and stakeholder engagement appropriate for a recommendation system affecting user behaviour and content consumption.

**Risk Threshold Levels:** (Conservative/Moderate/Risk-Tolerant/Custom):<!--%THRESHOLD_LEVEL-->Moderate

**Rationale:**
Balanced approach appropriate for a recommendation system. Conservative on safety and fairness issues, but accepting moderate risks for innovation and system performance where harms are less severe or well-understood.
