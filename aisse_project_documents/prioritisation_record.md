# Planning & Prioritisation Record

## Project Context
*(These details are project-specific and will not be included in any reusable patterns)*

**Project Name** (full title of your project)
<!--%PROJ_NAME-->SmartCity Traffic AI: Adaptive Traffic Management System

**Current Development Stage** (choose from Concept, Prototype, Release Development, or Operations)
<!--%CURRENT_STAGE-->Prototype

## Stakeholder Input
[Brief summary of sessions/research conducted]

Conducted extensive stakeholder engagement including workshops with TfL operators, emergency services, disability advocacy groups, cycling organisations, and local business representatives. Analysed 6 months of traffic data and reviewed international best practices from similar systems in Singapore and Amsterdam.

See guidance. Initially fill in first three columns of these two tables, then update later with MoSCoW decisions.
### Impact Areas & Values Identified
<!--%IMPACT_IN-->
| Impact Area       | Description     | Stakeholder Priority | MoSCoW      | Rationale |
| ----------------- | --------------- | -------------------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Traffic Flow Efficiency | Reducing journey times and congestion | High | M | Core business objective and public expectation |
| Environmental Impact | Reducing emissions through optimised traffic flow | High | M | Climate commitments and legal requirements |
| Safety | Preventing accidents and protecting vulnerable road users | High | M | Legal duty of care and public safety priority |
| Accessibility | Ensuring system works for all road users including disabled | High | S | Equality Act compliance but complex implementation |
| Emergency Response | Prioritising emergency vehicle access | High | M | Life-saving capability requirement |
| Public Transport Efficiency | Optimising bus and cycle route performance | Medium | S | Important for modal shift goals |
| Economic Impact | Supporting business through reliable transport | Medium | C | Secondary benefit, difficult to measure directly |

### Risks Identified
<!--%RISKS_IN-->
| Impact Area | Risk | Description | Stakeholder Priority | MoSCoW | Rationale |
| ----------- | ---- | ----------- | -------------------- | ------ | --------- |
| Safety | System failure during peak times | High | M | Could cause accidents or gridlock |
| Accessibility | Algorithmic bias against slower-moving pedestrians | High | M | Legal and ethical requirement to address |
| Environmental Impact | Optimisation favouring cars over sustainable transport | Medium | S | Could undermine climate objectives |
| Emergency Response | AI blocking emergency vehicle priority | High | M | Life-threatening if not properly handled |
| Public Trust | Lack of transparency in traffic decisions | Medium | S | Important for public acceptance |
| Privacy | Tracking and profiling of road users | Medium | S | GDPR compliance and civil liberties concern |
| Economic Impact | Unequal impact on different areas of London | Low | C | Social equity concern but manageable |

### Tensions between values
See guidance. Record here any tensions noted in the process of identifying Values and Risks

- Efficiency vs. Safety: Faster traffic flow may conflict with pedestrian crossing times
- Individual vs. Collective Optimisation: System-wide efficiency may disadvantage some road users
- Environmental vs. Economic: Reducing car efficiency may impact business deliveries
- Transparency vs. Security: Explaining AI decisions may reveal exploitable system vulnerabilities
- Innovation vs. Reliability: Advanced features may introduce system complexity and failure risks

## AISSE Decisions

**AISSE Badge level commitment** (Bronze/Silver/Gold):<!--%BADGE_LEVEL-->Gold

**Rationale:** 
Critical public infrastructure affecting millions of Londoners daily. Gold level commitment ensures comprehensive safety assessment, extensive stakeholder engagement, and robust monitoring capabilities appropriate for high-stakes deployment.

**Risk Threshold Levels:** (Conservative/Moderate/Risk-Tolerant/Custom):<!--%THRESHOLD_LEVEL-->Conservative

**Rationale:**
Public safety implications and potential for widespread disruption require conservative risk approach. Any safety-related risks must be thoroughly mitigated before deployment in live traffic environment.
