### Context

**Purpose**
Describe the purpose of this system from the perspective of its users. What need or goal does this AI system address?
To provide personalised content recommendations that help users discover relevant and engaging articles, videos, and other content based on their interests, reading history, and preferences. The system aims to enhance user experience by surfacing high-quality content while maintaining fairness, transparency, and user control over the recommendation process.

**Environment**
Describe the context in which this system will operate (e.g. industry, work area, geographies, etc)
Digital content platform serving millions of users globally across web and mobile applications. The system operates 24/7 in a competitive media landscape where user engagement and content quality are critical success factors. Regulatory oversight includes GDPR, emerging AI legislation, and platform responsibility frameworks.

**Stakeholders**
List all groups who will be impacted by this system (direct users, affected parties, decision makers)
Primary users: Platform users seeking content, content creators publishing material
Secondary stakeholders: Advertisers, platform moderators, data protection teams, customer support
Decision makers: Product management, engineering leadership, legal and compliance teams, executive leadership

Identify any vulnerable or high-risk groups
Minors accessing age-appropriate content, users with mental health vulnerabilities who may be affected by certain content types, users from marginalised communities who may face algorithmic bias, content creators dependent on platform visibility for income

Note any specific cultural or demographic groups who are intended users or be affected
Global user base spanning diverse cultural backgrounds, languages, and content preferences. Content creators from underrepresented communities whose reach may be affected by algorithmic decisions. Users in regions with varying digital literacy levels and different expectations of algorithmic transparency.

## Categorisation of use-case

*(Combination of Purpose + Environment)*

**Purpose/Role** (What role does this AI play in users' lives?. Select ALL that apply:)
<!--%PURPOSE_CODE-->
- [ ] **Creates (C)** - Makes new things for users (new content creation)
- [x] **Decides (D)** - Chooses for users (decision making, recommendations)
- [x] **Finds (F)** - Finds things for users (identification, discovery, information retrieval)
- [x] **Predicts (P)** - Tells users what's coming (prediction, monitoring)
- [ ] **Helps (H)** - Provides guidance to users (digital assistance, performance improvement)
- [ ] **Acts (A)** - Takes actions for users (process automation, robotic automation)
- [ ] **Explains (E)** - Makes things clearer for users (summarising, interpretation, synthesising)
- [ ] **Translates (T)** - Converts input from one form to another (language translation, modality conversion, input recognition)
- [ ] **Unknown (?)** - The purpose or role of this system is not known or decided

**Environment** (In what context is the system operating? Select ONE or ? for unknown)
<!--%ENVIRONMENT_CODE-->
- [ ] **Low-stakes (L)** - Entertainment, convenience, internal tools
- [x] **Social-facing (S)** - Public interaction, reputation, relationships
- [ ] **High-stakes (H)** - Safety, health, finance, legal decisions, well-being affecting
- [ ] **Unknown (?)** - The environment for the use-case is not known or decided

## Categorisation of System Design Forces

**Autonomy level** (What level of autonomy does the system have in performing actions? Select ONE or ? for unknown)
<!--%AUTONOMY_CODE-->
- [ ] **Supervised(S)** - Human approves each action
- [x] **Monitored (M)** - Human has oversight and can intervene, but system operates independently
- [ ] **Independent (I)** - Performs actions without specific human input or oversight
- [ ] **Unknown (?)** - The autonomy level of the system is not known or decided

**Self-learning level** (What ability does the system have to change its own execution to reflect updated understanding or experiences? Select ONE or ? for unknown)
<!--%SELF_LEARNING_CODE-->
- [ ] **Static(S)** - Fixed capabilities, doesn't learn or change during normal operations.
- [x] **Adaptive/Agentic (M)** - Uses memory type structures or similar to improve responses and approaches.
- [ ] **Self-modifying (I)** - Can modify its own capabilities, processes or objectives.
- [ ] **Unknown (?)** - The self-learning level of the system is not known or decided.

**Persistence level** (What level of persistence does the system have in for users or context? Select ONE or ? for unknown)
<!--%PERSISTENCE_CODE-->
- [ ] **Transactional (T)** - Stateless, each interaction or session is independent.
- [x] **Stateful (S)** - Remembers context/history, builds continuity
- [ ] **Persistent (P)** - Ongoing pursuit of goals and task execution without requiring prompting
- [ ] **Unknown (?)** - The persistence level of the system is not known or decided.

**Capability Level** (What's the sophistication and power of the underlying system? Select ONE or ? for unknown)
<!--%CAPABILITY_CODE-->
- [ ] **Basic (B)** - Simple algorithms, narrow processing (rule-based, basic ML). Does what you expect, clear decisions, predictable failures
- [x] **Advanced (A)** - Sophisticated models with a degree of simulated reasoning (LLMs, multimodal models, complex ML), some surprises, novel failure modes. 
- [ ] **Emergent (E)** - Systems with unexpected or hard-to-predict capabilities. May produce new capabilities, unclear boundaries 
- [ ] **Unknown (?)** - The capability level of the system is not known or decided

**Data Sources** (select all that apply)
<!--%DATA_CODE-->
- [x] **Controlled Internal(I)** - Operating organisation's own data
- [x] **User-Provided(U)** - End users input
- [x] **Verified Public(V)** - Vetted datasets, government, academic sources
- [ ] **Unverified Public(W)** - Scraped web content, social media
- [x] **Third-Party Licensed(T)**

**Other Behaviours** (What other system behaviours are relevant? Select any/all applicable, leave blank if none apply)
<!--%OTHER_SYS_CODE-->
- [ ] **Agentic Interaction (A)** - System will operate in an agentic colony structure (i.e. communicating with and sharing work with other cognitive agents)
- [ ] **Upstream (U)** - System operates upstream of other cognitive agents (i.e. the system will call other AI to execute tasks).
- [ ] **Downstream (D)** - System is downstream of other cognitive agents (i.e. the system is called by other AI to execute tasks).
