# Risk Management Plan

*Converting prioritised risks into actionable risk management*

## Project Context
*(These details are project-specific and will not be included in any reusable patterns)*

**Project Name** (full title of your project)
<!--%PROJ_NAME-->AI-Powered Content Recommendation System

**Current Development Stage** (choose from Concept, Prototype, Release Development, or Operations)
<!--%CURRENT_STAGE-->Prototype

## Impact Areas Being Managed
*Impact areas where risks are being addressed*
<!--%IMP_RISKS-->
| Impact Area | Description | Key Focus |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Fairness and representation | Ensuring AI system works equitably for all user groups | Risk mitigation - bias detection and algorithmic fairness |
| System transparency | Making AI decisions understandable and explainable to users | Risk mitigation - explainability features and user communication |
| Information integrity | Ensuring AI system provides accurate, reliable information | Risk mitigation - content verification and misinformation detection |
| Data control | Ensuring users maintain control over their personal data | Risk mitigation - privacy controls and data governance |

## Overall Risk Status
*Aggregate view for transparency without exposing sensitive details*

**Current Aggregate Risk Level:** <!--%RISK_STATUS-->Yellow
**Number of risks being tracked:** <!--%RISK_COUNT-->10
**Risk breakdown:** <!--%RISK_BREAKDOWN-->6 Green, 3 Yellow, 1 Red

## Detailed Risk Register (Optional - for teams wanting full transparency)

<!--%RISK_REG-->
| Risk ID | Risk Description | Impact (1-5) | Likelihood (1-5) | Risk Score | Zone | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|------------|------|---------------------|
| R001 | Specific groups bear costs/risks disproportionately | 4 | 4 | 25 | R | Fairness testing across demographic groups, bias monitoring dashboard, algorithmic auditing |
| R002 | People do not understand and so don't trust how decisions are made | 3 | 4 | 19 | Y | User-friendly explanation features, transparency reports, recommendation reasoning display |
| R003 | System generates or spreads false misleading or harmful information | 5 | 3 | 22 | Y | Content verification pipeline, fact-checking integration, harmful content detection |
| R004 | People lose sight and control of their data | 3 | 3 | 14 | Y | Privacy dashboard, data deletion capabilities, clear consent mechanisms |
| R005 | External manipulation of deployed system causing harmful decisions | 4 | 2 | 13 | G | Anomaly detection, rate limiting, manipulation detection algorithms |
| R006 | Compromise of development pipeline leading to harmful system behaviours | 4 | 2 | 11 | G | Secure development practices, code review, access controls, pipeline monitoring |

## Risk Review Schedule
**Review Frequency:** Bi-weekly during prototype phase, weekly before production deployment
