# Risk Management Plan

*Converting prioritised risks into actionable risk management*

## Project Context
*(These details are project-specific and will not be included in any reusable patterns)*

**Project Name** (full title of your project)
<!--%PROJ_NAME-->SmartCity Traffic AI: Adaptive Traffic Management System

**Current Development Stage** (choose from Concept, Prototype, Release Development, or Operations)
<!--%CURRENT_STAGE-->Prototype

## Impact Areas Being Managed
*Impact areas where risks are being addressed*
<!--%IMP_RISKS-->
| Impact Area | Description | Key Focus |
|-------------|-------------|------------|
| Safety | Preventing accidents and protecting vulnerable road users | Risk mitigation - system failure safeguards |
| Emergency Response | Prioritising emergency vehicle access | Risk mitigation - backup override systems |
| Accessibility | Ensuring system works for all road users | Risk mitigation - bias detection and correction |
| Environmental Impact | Reducing emissions through optimised traffic flow | Opportunity enhancement with risk mitigation |

## Overall Risk Status
*Aggregate view for transparency without exposing sensitive details*

**Current Aggregate Risk Level:** <!--%RISK_STATUS-->Yellow
**Number of risks being tracked:** <!--%RISK_COUNT-->12
**Risk breakdown:** <!--%RISK_BREAKDOWN-->8 Green, 3 Yellow, 1 Red

## Detailed Risk Register (Optional - for teams wanting full transparency)
*Complete this section only if you want to share detailed risk information*
<!--%RISK_REG-->
| Risk ID | Risk Description | Impact (1-5) | Likelihood (1-5) | Risk Score | Zone | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|------------|------|---------------------|
| R001 | System failure during peak traffic hours | 5 | 2 | 25 | R | Redundant systems, automatic fallback to manual control |
| R002 | Algorithmic bias against slower pedestrians | 4 | 3 | 19 | Y | Bias testing with disabled user groups, adjustable timing parameters |
| R003 | Emergency vehicle priority failure | 5 | 1 | 13 | Y | Dedicated emergency override system, 24/7 monitoring |
| R004 | Privacy breach from traffic monitoring | 3 | 2 | 11 | G | Data anonymisation, encrypted storage, minimal data retention |
| R005 | Unequal optimisation across different areas | 3 | 3 | 14 | Y | Equity metrics monitoring, geographical balancing algorithms |
| R006 | Cyber-security attack on traffic systems | 5 | 2 | 22 | R | Air-gapped critical systems, penetration testing, incident response plan |

## Risk Review Schedule
**Review Frequency:** Weekly during prototype phase, escalating to daily before live deployment
