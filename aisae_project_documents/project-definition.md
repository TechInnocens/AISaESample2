# MedAssist Diagnostic AI

## Project Overview

MedAssist is an AI-powered diagnostic assistance tool that helps radiologists identify potential abnormalities in medical imaging (X-rays, CT scans, MRIs). The system provides preliminary analysis and highlights areas of concern to support clinical decision-making.

## Project Description

The system analyzes medical images using deep learning models trained on large datasets of annotated medical imagery. It provides confidence scores for various conditions and generates heatmaps showing areas of concern. The tool is designed to augment radiologist expertise, not replace human judgment.

Key capabilities:
- Multi-modal medical image analysis
- Confidence scoring and uncertainty quantification
- Integration with existing PACS systems
- Audit trails for regulatory compliance
- Performance monitoring and model drift detection

## Current Status

- **Development Progress**: 100% complete
- **Current Phase**: Live deployment in 12 hospitals
- **Performance**: 94% sensitivity, 89% specificity for primary use cases
- **Regulatory Status**: CE marked, FDA 510(k) approved
- **Team Size**: 15 clinical engineers, 5 radiologists, 3 regulatory specialists
